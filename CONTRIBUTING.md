# Contributing
Firstly, thanks for your contribution!

* If you have a trivial fix or improvement, go ahead and create a pull request, addressing any maintainer of that component in the description of the pull request.
* If you plan to do something more involved, you should probably open an issue so we can talk about it. However you can also just create the pull request and the issue and we can discuss the concept in the issue and the implementation in the pull request.
* In terms of coding styles, I'm a native english speaker who just read [Clean Code](https://www.amazon.com/Clean-Code-Handbook-Software-Craftsmanship/dp/0132350882)(tm) so I tend to value readable code.  Note this specifically goes against the Golang convention of using variable names like 'a', 'b' and so on.  We value readable code and as such, do not follow this golang convention.


# side/related 
* This is an open source project, so commits/pull request are welcome. Forks are awesome. Issues are abundant and highly desired.
